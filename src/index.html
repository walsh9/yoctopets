  <h1>yoctoPets</h1>

<p>The life of a yoctoPet is tiny, brutish, and short. But with your care they can live out their lives in happiness and health.</p>

<h2>Care Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When a yoctoPet cries out for attention (!!), it usually needs something. Check the <b>stats screen</b> to see what's wrong.</li>
  <li>If a yoctoPet doesn't want to do something, it will proudly refuse. <b>Don't take it personally.</b></li>
  <li>A balanced diet helps keep your yoctoPet healthy. Fruit is nutritious and filling. Candy is fun but unhealthy. There are only two foods. <b>There are no secret foods.</b></li>
  <li>yoctoPets love to play Hi-Lo. This is a card game where you win by guessing whether the next card dealt will be higher or lower than the last. <b>Aces are high.</b> Three correct guesses in a row wins!</li>
  <li>When the <b>skull icon</b> appears it means your yoctoPet is ill. Give it some medicine!</li>
  <li>Even the best cared for yoctoPets will eventually die. Learn to let go. Or <b>take pictures</b> to remember the good times.</li>
</ul>
